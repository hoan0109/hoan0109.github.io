<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
<hr>
    <p>
        Hello my name is <em>Joseph Hoang</em>. I am a 17 years old student in the Interactive Media Design (IMD) program at Algonquin College.
        I was born in Ottawa, Canada and lived here my whole life. The reason I chose this program is because I love to travel and document my journey
        through photography and videography. I like to use apps like Adobe Lightroom and Premiere to edit. When I saw that this program uses those
        application I knew this was the program for me. After completing my studies and graduating at Algonquin College I hope to land a job making cool apps and
        websites.

        Some hobbies include playing sports and video  games. I enjoy playing soccer and basketball. I use to go outside and play pickup basketball almost every day
        but recently stopped due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I also occasionally enjoy playing video game like Valorant and NBA 2k with friends when I have free time. 
        Playing video games is a great way to talk or catch up with some friends while having fun. I also recently picked up cooking as a hobby. I enjoy learning and
        creating different dished around the world.

<h2><strong>Quote</strong></h2>
<hr>

    <p>
        One of my favourite quote is from one of my favourite athletes: <em>"If you're afraid to fail, your're probably going to fail. -Kobe Bryant"</em>
        Kobe Bryant is one of my favourite athlete not only because of his talent as a basketball player but also his mentality. He is very well known for his hard work
        and dedication to the game. Many people have said he is the most hardworking athlete. This quote is saying that if your are afraid to fail by not pushing yourself 
        enough, your are failing.
